# `pageVisibilityTracker`

This guide explains what the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin is and how to integrate it into your `analytics.js` tracking implementation.

## Overview

It's becoming increasingly common for users to visit your site, and then leave it open in a browser tab for hours or days. And with rise in popularity of [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs) and [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWAs) some tabs almost never get closed.

Because of this shift, the traditional model of pageviews and sessions simply does not apply in a growing number of cases.

The `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin changes this paradigm by shifting from page load being the primary indicator to [Page Visibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API). To understand why this is important, consider this scenario: you've just updated your website to be able to fetch new content in the background and display it to the user when they return to your page (without forcing them to reload). If you were only using the default analytics.js tracking snippet, this change would result is dramatically fewer pageviews, even though the user is consuming the same amount of content.

By taking Page Visibility into consideration, the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin is able to report consistent numbers regardless of whether the user needs to reload the page.

The `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin also calculates how long a given page was in the visible state for a given session, which is a much better indicator of user engagement than [*Session Duration*](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1006253).

The following sample reports show how you can use the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin to more accurately measure user engagement with your content.

**Top pages by visible time:**

### How it works

The `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin listens for [`visibilitychange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/visibilitychange) events on the current page and sends hits to Google Analytics capturing how long the page was in the visible state. It also programmatically starts new sessions and sends new pageviews when the visibility state changes from hidden to visible (if the previous session has timed out).

Optionally you can set [configuration options](#options) to let the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin handle sending the initial pageview. When set, the plugin will send the initial pageview if the page is loaded in the visible state. If it's loaded in a background tab, the plugin will wait until the page is visible before sending the inital pageview.

**Note:** if you configure the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin to send the initial pageview, make sure you remove the `ga('send', 'pageview')` command from your tracking snippet.


### Impact on session and pageview counts

When using the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin, you may notice an increase or decrease in session and pageview counts. This is not an error, the reality is your current implementation (based just on page loads) is likely inaccurate.

If your users tend to leave your site open in a background tab and switch to it frequently, you'll likely notice an increase in session and pageview counts. By contrast, if a significant portion of your users load your site in a background tab and later close the tab without ever viewing the content, you'll likely see your session and pageview counts go down.

**Note:** you can set the [`pageLoadsMetricIndex`](#options) option to track page loads (via a [custom metric](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828)) separately from pageviews in the event you also want to know how often your pages are loaded.

## Usage

To enable the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin, run the [`require`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/using-plugins) command, specify the plugin name `'pageVisibilityTracker'`, and pass in any configuration options (if any) you wish to set:

```js
ga('require', 'pageVisibilityTracker', options);
```

### Using custom and calculated metrics

The easiest way to track the time a page was visible is to create a [custom metric](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828) called *Page Visible Time* that you set in your plugin configuration options, and then to create [calculated metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6121409) called *Avg. Page Visible Time (per Page)* and *Avg. Page Visible Time (per Session)* that you use in your reports.

Which calculated metric you need will depend on which dimensions you're using in your report. For page-specific dimensions (e.g. *Page* or *Title*) you'll want to use the page version, and for session-level dimensions (e.g. *Referrer* or *Device Category*) you'll want to use the session version.

Here are the formulas for both:

```
{{Page Visible Time}} / {{Unique Pageviews}}
```

```
{{Page Visible Time}} / {{Sessions}}
```

The screenshots in the [overview](#overview) shows some examples of what reports with these custom and calculated metrics look like.

## Options

The following table outlines all possible configuration options for the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin. If any of the options has a default value, the default is explicitly stated:

      The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795871">session timeout</a> amount (in minutes) of the Google Analytics property. By default this value is 30 minutes, which is the same default used for new Google Analytics properties. The value set for this plugin should always be the same as the property setting in Google Analytics.<br>

## Default field values

### Page Visibility events

The `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin sets the following default field values on event hits it sends. To customize these values, use one of the [options](#options) described above.

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">Field</th>
    <th align="left">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#hitType"><code>hitType</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'event'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#eventCategory"><code>eventCategory</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'Page Visibility'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#eventAction"><code>eventAction</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'track'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#eventValue"><code>eventValue</code></a></td>
    <td>The elapsed time (in seconds) spent in the visible state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#nonInteraction"><code>nonInteraction</code></a></td>
    <td><code>true</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New pageviews

If the page's visibility state changes from `hidden` to `visible` and the session has timed out, a new pageview is sent.

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">Field</th>
    <th align="left">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#hitType"><code>hitType</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'pageview'</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Page load hits

If the `sendInitialPageview` option is set and the page's visibility state is visible, a pageview is sent with the following default field values:

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">Field</th>
    <th align="left">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#hitType"><code>hitType</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'pageview'</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the `pageLoadsMetricIndex` option is set in addition to the `sendInitialPageview` option (and the page was loaded in the visible state), a pageview is sent with the following default field values:

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">Field</th>
    <th align="left">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#hitType"><code>hitType</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'pageview'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><code>metric&lt;pageLoadsMetricIndex&gt;</code></td>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the `sendInitialPageview` and `pageLoadsMetricIndex` options are set, and the page was loaded in a background tab, an event is sent with the following default field values:

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">Field</th>
    <th align="left">Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#hitType"><code>hitType</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'event'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#eventCategory"><code>eventCategory</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'Page Visibility'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#eventAction"><code>eventAction</code></a></td>
    <td><code>'page load'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><code>metric&lt;pageLoadsMetricIndex&gt;</code></td>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#nonInteraction"><code>nonInteraction</code></a></td>
    <td><code>true</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Methods

For details on how `analytics.js` plugin methods work and how to invoke them, see [calling plugin methods](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/using-plugins#calling_plugin_methods) in the `analytics.js` documentation.

## Examples

### Configuring the plugin to send the initial pageview

To let the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin handle sending the initial pageview for you when the page is visible, set the `sendInitialPageview` option to true:

```js
ga('require', 'pageVisibilityTracker', {
  sendInitialPageview: true,
});
```

Note that when using the `sendInitialPageview` option, you no longer need the `ga('send', 'pageview')` command in your tracking snippet:

```js
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');

// Require other autotrack plugins as needed.
ga('require', 'pageVisibilityTracker', {
  sendInitialPageview: true,
});

// The command below is no longer needed.
// ga('send', 'pageview');
```

### Setting a session timeout and time zone

If you've set the default session timeout in your Google Analytics property to 4 hours and the timezone of all your views to Pacific Time, you can ensure the `pageVisibilityTracker` plugin knows about these settings with the following configuration options:

```js
ga('require', 'pageVisibilityTracker', {
  sessionTimeout: 4 * 60,
  timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
});
```

### Setting custom metrics to track page loads and visible time

If you want to track page load (in addition to pageviews) as well as the total (or average) time a user spends in the visible state on your site, you can do so via [custom metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828) and the `pageLoadsMetricIndex` and `visibleMetricIndex` options.

```js
ga('require', 'pageVisibilityTracker', {
  sendInitialPageview: true,
  pageLoadsMetricIndex: 1,
  visibleMetricIndex: 2,
  timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
});
```

**Note:** this requires [creating custom metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829) in your Google Analytics property settings.
